### Hi there!! Welcome to my GitHub profile

My name is Mauricio Junior, I'm a 26 years old tech, coding and PC hardware enthusiast, and also a Mechatronics Engineering Student.

Here is where I put some of my little projects and inspirations. Feel free to explore the public repositories and if you have any suggestions, first buy me a coffee and then we can talk about it.

The languages that I program (Or know the basics to print Hello World) are:

  1 - Python
  
  2 - C/C++ (For Arduino and Microcontrolled Projects)
  
  3 - Java (Android Developing)
  
  4 - Dart (For Flutter Projects)
  
  5 - MySQL (Just the very basics)
  
  6 - Web Developing (HTML, CSS, and Javascript)
  
Also, Thanks to the Mechatronics Engineering, I have some knoledge in Ladder development for PLC's.

Right now I'm more focused on studying web development and Flutter for mobile development. And applying my knoledges working on a website (one of my "little projects" hehe). but you can find me on social media, it will be down below and feel free to send a message!
